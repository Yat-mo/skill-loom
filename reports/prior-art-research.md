# Prior-Art Research

## Progressive project-skill architecture integration 2.9

- Researched at: 2026-08-08
- User-specified reference: [`WoJiSama/skill-based-architecture`](https://github.com/WoJiSama/skill-based-architecture) at `7169668151505cc09fec1248127549540ff12a76`
- Base fork: [`joeseesun/qiaomu-meta-skill`](https://github.com/joeseesun/qiaomu-meta-skill) at `9d9eafe012e327258228186b5e816534c2951333`
- Scope: add proportional project-rule architecture, route-time activation, concrete verification checks, new-task route discipline, and Codex adapter support without replacing Qiaomu's research/eval/release authority
- License: both repositories are MIT
- Catalog metrics: not used for this user-directed integration; popularity is not the selection premise
- Built-in catalog smoke: 2/2 queries completed across skills.sh and SkillsMP; 51 deduplicated candidate families were preserved in `reports/prior-art-candidates.json`

### Keep

- structure serves content
- activation over storage
- reusable scaffolding without prefilled project content
- principle plus executable/self-question check
- every new task re-matches its route
- task anchors for non-trivial work
- route reachability, generated-adapter consistency, and AAR learning gates

### Adapt

- Three structural tiers replace a mandatory full project scaffold.
- `routing.yaml`, thin shells, hooks, and Cursor entries are earned, target-specific adapters rather than universal files.
- Line budgets are evaluation signals, not automatic split commands.
- AAR is limited to non-trivial mutations; pure Q&A and read-only advice are exempt.
- Cross-harness source remains platform-neutral while Codex gets `agents/openai.yaml`.

### Reject

- `primary: true` in Codex-facing frontmatter because it is not part of the Codex skill contract.
- mandatory subagent workflows because harness and user policy may forbid delegation.
- prefilled gotchas, rationalization tables, business rules, or project-specific examples.
- duplicate hand-edited route tables across AGENTS/CLAUDE/CODEX/Cursor surfaces.
- assigning Qiaomu ownership or profile assets to third-party packages without an explicit owner decision.

### Invent

- an owner-scoped publishing profile policy
- a single progressive architecture reference that Qiaomu can route to without bloating the root `SKILL.md`
- an explicit Codex adapter gate tied to declared OpenAI targets
- Python 3.9 compatibility coverage for the built-in SkillsMP research path

### Evidence boundary

Source-level integration, trigger tests, route checks, package validation, and clean installation can validate mechanics. Long-session adherence, maintenance outcomes, and human usefulness remain `missing evidence` until observed in real projects.

## Self-contained publishing integration 2.8

- Researched at: 2026-08-04
- Reference: [`joeseesun/qiaomu-skill-publisher`](https://github.com/joeseesun/qiaomu-skill-publisher) at `8bd944b7723e710d38f9fa4034e8ba6addbbdfed`
- Scope: absorb its useful publishing behavior into the current meta-skill package so creation and publication no longer require a second skill
- License: MIT

### Keep

- strict frontmatter parsing and repository/skill-name separation
- MIT LICENSE creation
- README generation and placeholder checks
- Qiaomu profile/QR asset injection with stable markers
- `npx skills add --list` discovery and real temporary installation
- optional canonical `~/.agents/skills/<name>` synchronization

### Adapt

- Profile assets now come from the package's `assets/qiaomu-profile`, removing the runtime dependency on a separate `qiaomu-profile` skill.
- README validation combines publisher placeholders with the meta validator's product-page, upstream-credit and evidence requirements.
- Repository creation uses an initial baseline followed by feature-branch PR publication, including for brand-new repositories.
- Local synchronization moves an existing target to `~/.agents/skill-backups` before replacement, outside recursive skill discovery.

### Reject

- `git push origin main` and `git push HEAD:main`: conflict with governed review and the global no-default-branch rule.
- swallowing push failures and still returning a repository URL: creates false completion claims.
- deleting the existing canonical skill directory with `shutil.rmtree`: risks data loss and removes rollback.
- verifying after an unsafe direct push: install proof cannot repair a broken publication path.
- reusing an existing release version for new content: violates immutable release expectations.

### Invent

- one self-contained `scripts/publish_skill.py` with read-only dry-run, prepare-only, PR-only, full publish and verify-only modes
- PR mergeability, requested-review and status-check gate
- version immutability guard before publication
- reuse of the bundled `local / pr / published` release checker inside the publisher
- structured JSON results that separate repository, PR, release, discovery, installation and local-sync evidence

### Evidence boundary

The integration can validate packaging and publication mechanics. It cannot establish domain output quality, user adoption or business outcomes. Those remain separate output/runtime/human evidence or `missing evidence`.

- Researched at: 2026-07-30
- Scope: improve the meta-skill package with a repeatable discover-compare-synthesize gate
- Queries: `skill creator`, `skill evaluation`, `meta skill`, `create agent skills`
- Discovery method at research time: skills.sh via the Skills CLI plus direct source review. SkillsMP was added to the built-in method on 2026-08-03 and did not contribute to this historical shortlist.
- Rating evidence: unavailable. The public skills.sh ranking and API expose install telemetry, not user star ratings or written reviews.

| Candidate | Relevance | Installs on 2026-07-30 | Quality and trust evidence | Keep / adapt | Reject / limit | License note |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| `anthropics/skills@skill-creator` | Direct skill creation and iteration | 333.1K–333.2K | First-party source; 165,077 repository stars; three skills.sh audits passed; actively maintained | intent capture, realistic evals, old-vs-new baseline, qualitative plus quantitative review, trigger-description optimization | do not copy its large Claude-specific orchestration or require heavy benchmarking for every skill | repository contains mixed licensing; verify file-level terms before reuse |
| `openai/skills@skill-creator` | Direct Codex-compatible authoring guidance | 2.8K–2.9K | First-party source; 24,321 repository stars; three skills.sh audits passed; actively maintained | concise instructions, progressive disclosure, appropriate degrees of freedom, initialization and validation discipline | popularity is lower and is not a quality verdict; do not treat generic anatomy text as domain insight | verify repository/file license before reuse |
| `wshobson/agents@evaluation-methodology` | Complementary evaluation discipline | 4.8K | 38,358 repository stars; MIT repository; actively maintained | weighted dimensions, trigger-first prioritization, before/after comparison, confidence/evidence awareness | do not adopt claimed scores, badges, or Monte Carlo gates without running and validating the referenced toolchain | MIT at repository level |

## Synthesis ledger

### Keep

- Search before drafting and inspect actual source, not only result snippets.
- Treat routing, output quality, robustness, and token cost as separate evaluation surfaces.
- Compare an improved skill against the old version or a no-skill baseline when the added rigor is justified.
- Use progressive disclosure and deterministic validation scripts.

### Adapt

- Make prior-art discovery mandatory for new or substantial skill work, but proportional: a compact handoff for Scaffold, a durable report for Production and above.
- Use installs as an adoption signal and first-party/audit/repository data as trust signals. Keep each signal labeled instead of collapsing them into one score.
- Keep Qiaomu's lighter gate ladder and Chinese-first packaging while borrowing rigorous evaluation patterns only where they improve the output contract.

### Reject

- Ranking candidates by installs alone.
- Calling GitHub stars, installs, curated status, or security audits “user ratings.”
- Auto-installing or executing every candidate skill during research.
- Copying upstream prose or combining entire workflows into a bloated collage.
- Requiring expensive multi-agent or Monte Carlo evaluations for low-risk personal scaffolds.

### Invent

- A four-part `keep / adapt / reject / invent` contribution ledger that makes the original synthesis explicit.
- A three-role shortlist: popularity anchor, trust anchor, and complementary specialist.
- A privacy-aware degradation path that avoids leaking sensitive search terms and records `missing evidence` instead of fabricating confidence.
- A dated `reports/prior-art-research.md` artifact linked to Production+ gates.

## Original contribution

Qiaomu Meta Skill 2.1 turns ecosystem discovery into a defensible research gate. It does not promise to choose a universal “best” skill; it selects relevant evidence, separates popularity from sentiment and trust, documents what was rejected, then requires an original contribution tied to the user's output contract.

## Missing evidence

- skills.sh did not expose a public user-rating or written-review field during this research.
- No head-to-head output benchmark was run for the three upstream skills because their platforms, toolchains, and output contracts differ.
- Repository-level stars and licenses do not automatically apply to every file; file-level reuse terms must still be checked before copying or redistribution.
